# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to **[Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)**. Version syntax is
`{major}.{minor}.{patch}`, where a field bump means:

- **Patch**: The release contains bug fixes.
- **Minor**: As long as `major` is 0, those releases may contain breaking
  changes.
- **Major**: A bump to `1.x` means that the API is stable and that minor updates
  won't contain breaking changes anymore.

**Remember:** This is a beta release, the API is not stable yet. Only minor
updates are guaranteed to respect backward-compatibility. For minor and major
releases, please check this changelog before upgrading.
