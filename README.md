Easy Trezor wallet support for Stellar applications.

## Introduction

This is a convenient wrapper around the official
[TrezorConnect](https://github.com/trezor/connect) library.

It enables you to connect to Trezor devices and sign Stellar transactions in
a few lines of code:

```js
// Step 1: Register to Trezor Connect Manifest
trezorWallet.register("example.org", "dev@example.org")

// Step 2: Connect
await trezorWallet.connect()

// Step 3: Get public key
const pubkey = trezorWallet.publicKey

// Step 4: Sign
await trezorWallet.sign(transaction)
```

This library is browser-only.

**Beta Release**

This is a beta release that is made public for testing purpose. While the
library is stable & secure, several issues are still being worked out with
Trezor teams.

A few operations & parameters are not supported yet. An explicit error
message will get thrown if you try to sign a transaction including them:

- Text memos using binary data,
- The `bumpSequence` operation,
- The `changeTrust` operation,
- The `inflation` operation,
- The `manageData` operation,
- The `manageBuyOffer` operation,

If you encounter an unexpected error, please play the game and [fill an
issue](https://github.com/cosmic-plus/js-trezor-wallet/issues/new/choose).

The public release will possibly contain one or more breaking changes.
Please check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

## Usage

### Methods

#### trezorWallet.register(email, appUrl)

Registers yourself in the Trezor Connect Manifest. This provides them the
ability to reach you in case of any required maintenance.

This subscription is mandatory.

**See**: [Trezor Connect Manifest](https://github.com/trezor/connect/blob/develop/docs/index.md#trezor-connect-manifest)

| Param  | Type     | Description      |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------- |
| email  | `String` | Developer email. |
| appUrl | `String` | Application URL. |

#### await trezorWallet.connect([account])

Waits for a connection with a Trezor wallet. If **account** is not provided,
acount 1 is used. The library will stop listening for a connection if
`trezorWallet.disconnect()` is called.

Once the connection is established, you can use `await trezorWallet.connect()` again at any time to ensure the device is still
connected.

When switching to another **account**, it is possible to `await trezorWallet.connect(new_account_number)` without prior disconnection.

_Note:_ To stay consistent with the way Trezor list accounts, **account**
starts at 1 and account 1 BIP path is `m/44'/148'/0'`.

| Param     | Type                 | Default | Description                                                                   |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [account] | `Number` \| `String` | `1`     | Either the account number (starts at 1) or a BIP path (e.g: "m/44'/148'/0'"). |

#### await trezorWallet.sign(transaction)

Prompts the user to accept **transaction** using the connected account of
their Trezor device.

If the user accepts, adds the signature to **transaction**. Else, throws an
error.

| Param       | Type          | Description              |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| transaction | `Transaction` | A StellarSdk Transaction |

#### trezorWallet.disconnect()

Close the connection with the Trezor device, or stop listening for one in
case a connection has not been established yet.

### Events

#### trezorWallet.onConnect : `function`

_Function_ to execute on each connection.

#### trezorWallet.onDisconnect : `function`

_Function_ to execute on each disconnection.

### Members

#### trezorWallet.publicKey : `String`

PublicKey of the connected account.

#### trezorWallet.path : `String`

BIP path of the connected account.
